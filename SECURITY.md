# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it responsibly.

## Preferred Method: GitHub Private Reporting
Use GitHub’s private security advisory workflow:
https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-sap-hana-backint-cos/security/advisories/new

## Alternative Reporting Methods (Official IBM PSIRT)

If you cannot use GitHub’s private reporting feature, you may report the vulnerability through IBM’s Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT):

- IBM Security Vulnerability Management (PSIRT):
  https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-vulnerability-management

- Anonymous reporting form:
  https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/feedback/security-psirt

- Report via email (PGP encryption optional):
  Refer to instructions on the PSIRT page above.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

IBM aims to acknowledge vulnerability reports within standard PSIRT timelines.
